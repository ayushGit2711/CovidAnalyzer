# CovidAnalyzer
A student of IIITD did a survey to find the status of COVID-19 cases in his society. He worked for a few months and found that, out of 1000 people in his society (in different towers of his society) 20 were COVID-19 positive. So according to the detailed report he summarized the below mentioned data. A person will recover after 21 days. Now he wanted to categorize the cases.The program prompts the user for the Tower and the reporting date as input. For the tower category, use a Checkbox. Constraint- All the input dates must lie within these 5 months(April 2020 - August 2020) only.Output: The application displays: The number of active cases, number of recovered cases on a particular date(date taken as input) from each category(tower). It should also display all patient details (either Active or Recovered) along with their recovery dates. Use appropriate labels wherever required.
